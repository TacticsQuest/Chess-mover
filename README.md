## 🎮 Usage Guide

### 1. Basic Movement

```python
# Click any square on the board canvas to move gantry there
# Use arrow buttons for manual jogging
# Home button returns to origin
```

### 2. Board Calibration (3-Step Method!)

```python
1. Connect → Home to home the machine
2. Jog head to center of square A1
3. Click "📍 Set Current Position as A1"
4. Done! ✓
```

See [CALIBRATION_GUIDE.md](CALIBRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### 3. Profile Management

```python
# Create multiple board profiles
Settings → Manage Profiles → Create New

# Switch between profiles
Toolbar dropdown → Select profile

# Each profile stores:
- Board dimensions and calibration
- Piece dimensions
- Origin coordinates
```

See [PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md](PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md).

### 4. Chess Game Automation

```python
# Load PGN file
Game Panel → Load PGN → Select file

# Step through moves
Next Move button (or auto-play)

# Stockfish analysis
Analyze Position → Get best move
```

See [CHESS_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md](CHESS_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md).

### 5. Smart Storage System

```python
# Configure storage strategy
Settings → Storage Strategy → Select mode

# Available strategies:
- BY_COLOR: White/black separation
- BY_TYPE: Group by piece type
- NEAREST: Closest available spot
- CHRONOLOGICAL: Capture order

# Storage layouts:
- PERIMETER: Outer ring storage
- TOP: Top edge storage
- NONE: No storage (edge push)
```

See [SMART_STORAGE_GUIDE.md](SMART_STORAGE_GUIDE.md).

### 6. TacticsQuest Integration

```python
# Setup Supabase connection
TacticsQuest Panel → Configure → Enter credentials

# Enable sync
Toggle "Online Mode" → Select games to sync

# Automatic move execution
Opponent makes move in app → Machine executes on board!
```

See [TACTICSQUEST_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](TACTICSQUEST_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).

- Finds empty edge squares automatically
- Configurable push speed and distance

**Tool-Based Pusher**
- Professional piece removal using curved tool
- Tool pickup from designated holder
- Scooping motion for reliable piece ejection

Enable in `config/advanced_settings.yaml`:
```yaml
capture_removal:
  edge_push:
    enabled: true  # Enable edge push
  tool_pusher:
    enabled: true  # Enable tool pusher
```
