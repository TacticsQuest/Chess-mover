## 🔩 Phase 3 Deployment (Hardware Servos)

### Pre-Deployment Tasks

#### Enable I2C
```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Interface Options → I2C → Enable
sudo reboot
```

#### Test I2C
```bash
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
sudo i2cdetect -y 1
```

#### Install Servo Library
```bash
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-motor
```

#### Code Changes Required
1. **Uncomment hardware initialization** in `controllers/servo_controller.py`:

# Line 64-67 - UNCOMMENT for Phase 3:
from adafruit_servokit import ServoKit
self.pca9685 = ServoKit(channels=16)
self.is_connected = True
self.log("[SERVO] Connected to PCA9685")
```

2. **Update `_set_servo()` method** to use real hardware:

```python
# Line 89-92 - Already implemented, just ensure is_connected = True
if self.is_connected and self.pca9685:
    self.pca9685.servo[channel].angle = angle
    self.log(f"[SERVO] Channel {channel} → {angle}°")
```
