## ✅ TEST 4: Storage Capacity (3/3 passed)

| Profile | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Standard Chess 400mm | 0 squares | 0 squares | ✓ |
| Board with Top Storage | 16 squares | 16 squares | ✓ |
| Board with Perimeter Storage | 36 squares | 36 squares | ✓ |

**Calculations**:
- Top Storage: 8 files × 2 ranks = 16 squares
- Perimeter Storage: (10×10) - (8×8) = 100 - 64 = 36 squares

## ✅ TEST 5: Square Size Calculations (3/3 passed)

| Profile | Expected Size | Actual Size | Status |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Standard Chess 400mm | 50×50mm | 50.00×50.00mm | ✓ |
| Board with Top Storage | 50×40mm | 50.00×40.00mm | ✓ |
| Board with Perimeter Storage | 40×40mm | 40.00×40.00mm | ✓ |

**Note**: Square sizes automatically adjust based on grid dimensions to fit 400×400mm board.

## ✅ TEST 6: BoardState Integration (4/4 passed)

- ✓ Place white pawn on e5 (playing area)
- ✓ Place black rook on a1 (storage area)
- ✓ Place black queen on e10 (storage area)
- ✓ All pieces tracked correctly (3/3 pieces found)

**Result**: BoardState successfully tracks pieces in both playing and storage areas.

- ✓ Perimeter Storage: Returns 'a1'

### get_playing_area_offset()
- ✓ Standard Chess: Returns (0, 0)
- ✓ Top Storage: Returns (0, 0)
- ✓ Perimeter Storage: Returns (1, 1)

## Feature Summary

### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Storage Layout System**
   - Flexible configuration via YAML profiles
   - Four layout types: NONE, TOP, BOTTOM, PERIMETER
   - Automatic square classification (playing vs storage)

2. **Visual Rendering**
   - Storage squares use distinct gray color (#3a3a3a)
   - Playing squares use standard chess pattern (#ebecd0 / #779556)
   - Orange + bold labels for storage coordinates
   - Layout indicator label shows active configuration

3. **Piece Tracking**
   - BoardState tracks pieces on all squares
   - Works seamlessly with storage and playing areas
   - Machine always knows piece locations

4. **Workspace Integration**
   - All layouts fit within 400×415mm workspace
   - Automatic square size calculations
   - Origin and offset handling

5. **User Interface**
   - "Show Occupied Storage" toggle button
   - Occupied storage squares darken when toggle is ON
   - Profile switching via dropdown
   - Visual indicators for storage layout type
