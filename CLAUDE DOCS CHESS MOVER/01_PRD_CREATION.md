# 01 - Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation Workflow
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Purpose:** Standardized process for creating comprehensive PRDs for any project type

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT MODIFY THIS DOCUMENT**

**This is a REFERENCE document. Claude Code should READ and FOLLOW this document, but NEVER modify it unless the user explicitly requests an update.**

**Exception:** Only modify if the user specifically asks: "Update the Claude DOCS" or "Modify 01_PRD_CREATION.md"

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

This document guides Claude Code through creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) that clearly defines WHAT needs to be built and WHY, without prescribing HOW to build it. The PRD serves as the foundation for all subsequent work.

**Target Audience:** The PRD should be written as if explaining to a junior developer who understands code but needs explicit, unambiguous requirements.

```

---

## üéØ STEP 1: RECEIVE INITIAL REQUEST

When a user requests a new feature or project, Claude Code must:

1. **Acknowledge** the request
2. **Use TodoWrite** to track the PRD creation task
3. **Immediately proceed** to Step 2 (ask questions)

### Example Initial Requests:
- "I want to add a leaderboard to my chess game"
- "Create a tax deduction calculator"
- "Build a user authentication system"
- "Add dark mode to my app"

---

## üîç STEP 2: ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT skip this step. Always ask targeted questions to understand requirements fully.

### Question Framework:

#### A. Problem & Goals
```
- What problem does this solve for users?
- What is the primary goal of this feature?
- What does success look like?
- Are there any existing solutions you've seen that you like/dislike?
```

#### B. Target Users
```
- Who will use this feature?
- What is their technical skill level?
- What devices/platforms will they use? (desktop/mobile/both)
- Are there accessibility requirements?
```

#### C. Core Functionality
```
- What are the MUST-HAVE features (MVP)?
- What are the NICE-TO-HAVE features (future)?
- What workflows/user journeys are involved?
- What are the primary actions users will take?
```

#### D. Data Requirements
```
- What data needs to be stored?
- What data needs to be displayed?
- Are there any data sources/integrations? (APIs, databases, etc.)
- What are the data retention requirements?
```

#### E. Technical Context
```
- Does this integrate with existing systems? (List them)
- Are there performance requirements? (speed, scale, etc.)
- Are there specific technologies you want to use?
- What is the expected user load? (10 users? 10k users?)
```

#### F. Design & UX
```
- Do you have design references? (screenshots, mockups, websites to emulate)
- What is the desired look and feel? (modern, minimal, playful, professional)
- Are there brand colors/guidelines to follow?
- Any specific UI components needed? (modals, dropdowns, tables, etc.)
```

#### G. Scope Boundaries
```
- What is explicitly OUT of scope for this release?
- What are the dealbreakers (must not do)?
- What is the timeline/urgency?
- What is the priority vs. other work?
```

#### H. Edge Cases & Constraints
```
- What happens if [error scenario]?
- What are the rate limits/quotas?
- What are the security/privacy requirements?
- Are there compliance requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
```

### Example Question Set:
```markdown
To create a comprehensive PRD for the leaderboard feature, I need to understand:

**Problem & Goals:**
1. What problem does the leaderboard solve? (e.g., engagement, competition, recognition)
2. What defines success for this feature?

**Users:**
3. Is this for all users or specific user types?
4. Mobile, desktop, or both?

**Core Functionality:**
5. What metrics determine leaderboard rank? (wins, rating, puzzles solved, etc.)
6. Should it be global, friends-only, or both?
7. How often should rankings update? (real-time, hourly, daily)
8. How many top players should be displayed?

**Data:**
9. Do you already have user stats stored, or do we need to track them?
10. Should historical data be preserved? (e.g., "Top Player of March 2025")

**Design:**
11. Do you have reference leaderboards you like? (e.g., chess.com, lichess)
12. Should user profiles be clickable from the leaderboard?

**Scope:**
13. What's out of scope for v1? (e.g., filtering, time periods, achievements)
14. Timeline expectations?
```

---

## üìö STEP 3: RESEARCH CONTEXT (Use MCPs!)

Before drafting the PRD, Claude Code MUST:

### A. Check for Existing Patterns
```bash
# If this is an existing project:
1. Use Grep to search for similar features
2. Read relevant existing code
3. Check project documentation
```

### B. Research Best Practices
```bash
# Use Perplexity MCP:
"What are best practices for [feature type] in [tech stack]?"

# Use Context7 MCP:
"Get documentation for [library/framework] related to [feature]"

# Use WebSearch:
"Modern [feature type] implementation examples 2025"
```

### C. Check Existing MCPs/Tools
```bash
# Consult 08_MCP_TOOLS_REGISTRY.md to see if relevant MCPs exist
# Example: Building auth? Check if there's an Auth MCP available
```

### D. Verify Tech Stack
```bash
# Consult 09_LIBRARY_REGISTRY.md for recommended libraries
# Use WebSearch to verify library is current and maintained
```

|------|---------|---------|--------|
| [Date] | 1.0 | Initial creation | Claude Code |

````

---

## üíæ STEP 5: SAVE THE PRD

Once the PRD is drafted:

```bash
# Save to project's /docs directory or /tasks directory
# Filename format: PRD-[feature-name]-YYYY-MM-DD.md
# Example: PRD-leaderboard-2025-10-10.md
```

If the project has a `/tasks/` directory, save there. Otherwise, create `/docs/` directory.

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 6: USER REVIEW & APPROVAL

**CRITICAL APPROVAL GATE:**

1. Present the PRD to the user
2. Ask: "Please review this PRD. Does it accurately capture the requirements? Any changes needed?"
3. **WAIT for user approval before proceeding**
4. If changes requested, update PRD and repeat review
5. Once approved, update PRD status to "Approved" and add approval date

---

## üìä STEP 7: NEXT STEPS

After PRD approval, immediately:

1. Mark PRD task as completed in TodoWrite
2. Inform user: "PRD approved! Next step: Creating static UI mockup (see 02_STATIC_UI_MOCKUP.md)"
3. Ask: "Ready to proceed with static UI mockup?"
4. If yes, proceed to `02_STATIC_UI_MOCKUP.md`

---

## üß™ PRD QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before presenting the PRD to the user, verify:

- [ ] All clarifying questions have been asked and answered
- [ ] Research was conducted (MCP/WebSearch)
- [ ] User stories are specific and testable
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear and measurable
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are defined

- See how they rank globally
- Compare their performance to friends
- Feel motivated to improve through competition

### 1.3 Goals
- **Primary Goal:** Increase user engagement by 30% through competitive motivation
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Provide social proof for high-performing players
  - Create retention mechanism (users check back to see rank changes)

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- 70% of active users view leaderboard within first week
- 20% increase in daily games played
- 15% increase in user session duration

## üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Skipping clarifying questions | Leads to incorrect assumptions | Always ask questions in Step 2 |
| Prescribing HOW to build | PRD should focus on WHAT/WHY | Remove implementation details |
| Vague acceptance criteria | Can't verify completion | Make criteria specific and testable |
| No out-of-scope section | Scope creep risk | Explicitly state what's excluded |
| Missing user stories | No user perspective | Include 3-5 diverse user stories |
| No research | Reinventing the wheel | Use MCPs and WebSearch |
