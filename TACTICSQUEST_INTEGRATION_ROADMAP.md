# TacticsQuest + Chess Mover Machine Integration Roadmap

## Overview
Since you're building TacticsQuest (your own chess platform), these suggestions focus on **unique features that leverage the physical chess board** to enhance the TacticsQuest experience, avoiding redundancy with features TacticsQuest will already have.

---

## 1. **Physical Puzzle Solving** ⭐ TOP PRIORITY
> TacticsQuest serves puzzles → Chess Mover executes them physically

### Features:
- **Puzzle Setup**: Machine automatically sets up puzzle position from TacticsQuest
- **Physical Hints**:
  - Machine moves to "from" square and hovers (without picking up piece)
  - LED flashes on correct square
  - Progressive hints: first show piece to move, then destination
- **Instant Validation**:
  - Place piece on board → TacticsQuest validates instantly
  - Wrong move → Machine returns piece to original square
  - Correct move → Machine continues to next move
- **Tactile Learning**: Muscle memory from physically moving pieces
- **Blindfold Training**: Hide screen, solve puzzles purely by touch

**Why Physical Matters**: Studies show physical manipulation improves pattern recognition and memory retention vs clicking.

## 2. **Physical-Digital Hybrid Gameplay**
> Seamless sync between physical board and TacticsQuest app

### Features:
- **Bidirectional Sync**:
  - Move piece physically → Updates TacticsQuest position
  - Opponent moves in TacticsQuest → Machine executes move
- **Presence Detection**:
  - Sensors detect when user sits down → Auto-resume game
  - Walk away → Auto-pause clock
- **Physical Premoves**:
  - Place piece on destination square before opponent moves
  - Machine validates and executes when legal
- **Board State Recovery**:
  - Power loss → Position auto-restored from TacticsQuest cloud
  - Piece knocked over → Suggest correction from last known state

**Why Physical Matters**: Playing with real pieces is more engaging than clicking, especially for casual games.

## Next Steps

1. **Add TacticsQuest logo to UI** ✅ (Done - small, bottom-right corner)
2. **Build TacticsQuest API client** (Python SDK for Supabase)
3. **Implement puzzle fetching and setup**
4. **Add LED hardware** (WS2812B strip - ~$15 on Amazon)
5. **Build bidirectional sync protocol**

Would you like me to start with any specific feature? I recommend starting with **puzzle mode** since it's high-impact and relatively straightforward to implement.
