### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- Created `test_storage_features.py` - 49 comprehensive tests
- Created `TEST_RESULTS.md` - Detailed test report
- All storage layout features validated and working

### 4. ✅ Documentation
- `STORAGE_LAYOUTS.md` - Complete storage system documentation
- `TACTICSQUEST_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md` - Future integration plans
- Focus on unique physical board features that complement TacticsQuest
